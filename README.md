# WindowSizy

This is a WindowSizy, a very simple Webextension for resizing a browser window.

# Why?

I (JP) am working on a multi-screen computer setup; switching from my office to meeting rooms several times a day this means my screens (and their resolutions) change a lot throughout the day.

I simply don't like working in a full-screen Firefox window and I'd rather have, e.g., a 1440x1000 window when working on my primary screen. Switching screens messes with the window size so need to resize it after each switchâ€¦

I had been using various other Firefox add-ons in the past, e.g. [Firesizer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesizer/). Unfortunately, none of them had been (yet?) converted to a proper Webextension running in Firefox 57+.

So... I fired up my editor and started cranking code, with the help of my friend Thomas.
