# WindowSizy
This is a WindowSizy, a Webextension for resizing a browser window.

# Why?
I (JP) am working on a multi-screen computer setup; switching from my office to meeting rooms several times a day this means my screens (and their resolutions) change a lot throughout the day. I simply don't like working in a full-screen Firefox window, I'd rather have, e.g., a 1440x1000 window when working on my primary screen.

I had been using various other Firefox add-ons in the past, e.g. Firesizer, but none of them had been converted to a proper Webextension running in Firefox 57+. So... I fired up my editor and started cranking code, with the help of my friend Thomas.
